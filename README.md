AVD Ecosystem - Jinja2 Linter

The goal of this project is to build a Jinja2 linter that will provide the following capabilities:

- Validate syntax according to AVD style guide: https://avd.sh/en/latest/docs/contribution/style-guide.html
- Develop extension that works with VSCode and potentianly others IDEs i.e PyCharm
  - if supporting multiple IDEs adds to much complexity, support for VSCode will take priority
- Capability to run as a GitHub Action and used to enforce style in our CI pipeline
